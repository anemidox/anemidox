- 👋 Hi, I’m @anemidox [Dhanuja Dissanayake]
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Machine Learning, and Mathematics!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Assembly (x86)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI and Machine Learning projects, particularly in the areas of natural language processing or predictive modeling. I’m also         interested in working on projects that explore the intersection of technology and philosophy, especially those that incorporate aspects of cognitive science or ancient wisdom.
- 📫 How to reach me through GitHub (@anemidox), email at (dhanujadsanayke@gmail.com), or LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhanujadissanayake). Feel free to reach out for    collaboration or discussions related to AI, mathematics, and philosophy!
